# User Story: CariAku Chat Interface Implementation

As a user of CariAku, I want to interact with AI assistants through a user-friendly and engaging chat interface so that I can easily communicate my needs and receive helpful responses.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Header
   - [ ] Display the selected assistant's name and icon
   - [ ] Show the current conversation topic or a default title
   - [ ] Include a three-dot menu button for additional options (hardcoded, non-functional for MVP)

2. Chat Area
   - [ ] Implement distinct message bubbles for user (right-aligned) and assistant (left-aligned)
   - [ ] Use CariAku's color scheme to differentiate between user and assistant messages
   - [ ] Display hardcoded timestamps for each message
   - [ ] Show a subtle CariAku logo watermark in the chat background

3. Input Area
   - [ ] Implement a text input field at the bottom of the screen
   - [ ] Add a send button that adds the user's message to the chat when tapped
   - [ ] Include an attachment button (non-functional for MVP, but visually present)

4. Navigation Bar
   - [ ] Display the same navigation bar as on the home screen
   - [ ] Highlight the current section (Chat) in the navigation bar

5. Assistant Interaction
   - [ ] Show a hardcoded welcome message from the assistant when the chat is opened
   - [ ] Implement a "typing" indicator with CariAku branding (e.g., "CariAku lagi mikir...") that appears for 2 seconds before each assistant response
   - [ ] Provide 3-5 hardcoded responses that cycle when the user sends a message

6. Rich Media Support
   - [ ] Display at least one hardcoded image in an assistant's message to demonstrate inline image capability
   - [ ] Implement basic text formatting (bold, italic, bullet points) in hardcoded assistant messages

7. Quick Actions
   - [ ] Display 2-3 hardcoded quick reply buttons below an assistant's message
   - [ ] Tapping a quick reply button should add its text as a user message

8. User Feedback
   - [ ] Add a "helpful" button next to each assistant message
   - [ ] Implement a visual indication when the "helpful" button is tapped (e.g., color change)

9. Animations and Transitions
   - [ ] Implement smooth scrolling when new messages are added
   - [ ] Add a subtle entrance animation for new messages

10. Branding Elements
    - [ ] Use CariAku's color scheme and typography throughout the interface
    - [ ] Design custom chat bubbles that incorporate CariAku's visual identity

11. Accessibility
    - [ ] Ensure all elements have appropriate contrast ratios
    - [ ] Implement proper semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility

## Technical Notes

- Implement the chat interface using Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS
- Use hardcoded data for all assistant responses and quick actions
- Ensure the interface is responsive and works well on various screen sizes
- Implement the chat as a scrollable list, with new messages automatically scrolling into view
- Store the chat history in local state only; no persistence or backend integration required for MVP

## Definition of Done

- The chat interface is implemented according to all acceptance criteria
- The design is reviewed and approved by the UX/UI team
- The code passes all unit tests and UI tests
- The feature is tested on multiple devices (minimum 3 different screen sizes)
- Documentation is updated with any new components or significant implementation details
